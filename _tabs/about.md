## Spyridon Eftychios Kokotos 

### Undergraduate Student @ Ionian University 
>> March 15, 2023

Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Spyridon Eftychios Kokotos (aka Spyros), and I am an undergraduate student at the Department of Informatics at Ionian University. I am passionate about making a difference in the world, whether it be through donating blood, volunteering, or using technology to create positive change.

I have been a blood donor since December 14, 2022, and I strongly believe in the power of blood donation to save lives. My motto is "Donate blood and be the reason for someone's existence!" and I encourage everyone to join me in this important cause.

In February of 2023, I was honored to receive a scholarship from the Wikimedia Foundation, which recognizes my contributions to the open-source community. I am proud to be a part of this global movement, which is dedicated to promoting free and open access to knowledge for all. This scholarship grants me the benefit to attend onsite the annual Wikimedia Hackathon which takes place on May 19-21 in Athens, Greece. Developers from around the world will come together to improve the technological infrastructure and software that powers and benefits the Wikimedia Projects.

Since November of 2022, I have been volunteering at the IEEE Student Branch of Ionian University as an Activity Planning Member. This has given me the opportunity to work with like-minded individuals on a variety of exciting projects. Currently, I am organizing (as a volunteer) the 102nd Conference of Rectors of Greek Universities, which will take place in Corfu, Greece from March 20-23. It's a huge responsibility, but I am excited to be part of such an important event.

When I'm not donating blood, volunteering, or working on academic projects, you can find me sailing the seas, exploring new destinations, and experiencing the freedom of the open water. I believe that pursuing my passions and giving back to my community are essential components of a fulfilling life.

Thank you for visiting my website, and please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
