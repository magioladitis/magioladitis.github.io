## Corfu: Expectations for the future of the city.

The impressive old town of Corfu mesmerizes every person who lays eyes on its beauty. The charming narrow streets, combined with the restored houses and the idyllic landscape, leave passersby in awe. The city is distinguished by its rich history and cultural heritage. Undoubtedly, the residents of Corfu should feel particularly proud of living on the island. The Old Town of Corfu faces several problems, primarily related to the preservation and upgrading of buildings and infrastructure in the area. Some of these specific issues include:

*	Damaged buildings and attempts to acquire illegal constructions: Some buildings in the Old Town are in poor condition due to lack of maintenance and restoration. Furthermore, there have been attempts to acquire illegal buildings, which threaten the historical and cultural value of the area.

*	Traffic congestion: The Old Town is a pedestrianized area, and there is no possibility of accessing it by car in all its parts. However, pedestrian traffic on the sidewalks is often congested, especially during the summer months when the area is full of tourists.

People with mobility issues face several challenges in the Old Town of Corfu, as the area is known for its narrow streets and cobblestone courtyards. Some of the problems they encounter include:

**Lack of accessibility**: The old town is not easily accessible for people with mobility issues. The narrow streets and cobblestone courtyards make it difficult to navigate with a wheelchair or heavy objects, and in some cases, it may be impossible for someone to pass through.

**Non-existent access to buildings and attractions**: Many buildings and attractions in the Old Town have not been adapted for accessibility for people with mobility issues. This can make it difficult or impossible for individuals with mobility challenges to access these buildings and attractions. Problems with shops and restaurants: Many shops and restaurants in the Old Town have not been adapted for accessibility for people with mobility issues. This can make it challenging for individuals with mobility challenges to access these shops and restaurants.

**Lack of proper signage**: The Old Town doesn't always have appropriate signage for the adaptation of buildings and streets for people with mobility issues. This can make navigation in the area difficult for individuals with mobility challenges and increase the risk of accidents. Education and awareness: It is important to have education and awareness among the public and businesses regarding accessibility issues and the solutions that can help address them. This can be achieved through awareness campaigns and educational programs on how to address these issues and assist people with mobility challenges.

**Issues with shops and restaurants**: Many shops and restaurants in the Old Town have not been adapted for the accessibility of individuals with mobility issues. This can make access to shops and restaurants difficult for people with mobility challenges.

**Encouragement of businesses**: Businesses can be encouraged to prioritize accessibility and offer more inclusive services for individuals with mobility issues, such as installing elevators and ground-level compensations, improving signage and labeling for accessibility, as well as offering discounts to people with mobility challenges.

**Collaboration with local authorities**: Local authorities can collaborate with specialized designers and architects to explore optimal solutions for improving accessibility in the Old Town of Corfu.

*	Narrow alleyways: Many of the alleyways in the Old Town are very narrow, making it difficult for people with mobility issues, small children, or even large vehicles to access them.

*	Uphill and downhill alleys: The Old Town of Corfu is built on a hill, so many of the alleyways are either uphill or downhill. This can make it challenging for people with limited mobility to access them.

*	Sidewalks and shops: In many parts of the Old Town, there are either no sidewalks or they are very narrow. Additionally, many of the shops and restaurants in the Old Town have stairs or high thresholds, making it difficult for people with disabilities or families with strollers to enter and exit.

However, the authorities of Corfu have undertaken numerous initiatives to improve accessibility in the Old Town. For example, elevators have been installed at certain locations to facilitate access for individuals with limited mobility, and there have been upgrades to sidewalks and public spaces to make them more accessible for everyone. Additionally, the pedestrianized area of the Old Town allows for exploration on foot, providing visitors with a unique experience.

## Ways to solve these problems:

1. **Improvement of public transportation**: Consideration can be given to improving public transportation and adapting buses and taxis for individuals with mobility issues. Additionally, routes can be designed to accommodate accessibility measures at bus stops.

2. **Adaptation of buildings**: The adaptation of buildings in the Old Town can be explored to make them more accessible for individuals with mobility challenges. This may include installing elevators, redesigning building entrances and exits, and improving signage.

3. **Education and awareness**: It is important to provide education and raise awareness among the public and businesses about accessibility issues and the solutions that can help address them. This can be done through awareness campaigns and educational programs on how to address these problems and assist individuals with mobility challenges.
