Idea: Changing our living space to be accessible to everyone

Our school is located near the old town of Corfu, which is a tourist destination for thousands of tourists from abroad and within the country. However, the problem we have identified is that there are areas that are not accessible to people with disabilities. We will try to use technology and 3D printing to provide easy and affordable solutions for people with disabilities.

The students will document accessibility problems in their living space. After studying and mapping the area and taking photographs for analysis, they will propose solutions that can make the area in and around the historic city accessible to people with disabilities.

The main approaches we will take involve adding tactile signs for visually impaired individuals, either on signposts or in reading spaces, and adding Braille signs to elements of historical interest to make them accessible to visually impaired tourists. These constructions are easily achievable through 3D printing, and we will strive to implement them.
